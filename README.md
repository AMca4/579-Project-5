# 579-Project-5

Build a vehicle capable of playing a game of skittles in the corridor outside RC6.41. 
Two teams' vehicles will compete simultaneously, with a single set of 2 black metal 
“skittles” placed between 6 and 10 metres from both vehicles, and both vehicles 
beginning adjacent to each other. The skittles will consist of two tin soup cans 
soldered end to end and painted. 
You will be given a model car to modify. You are expected to retro-fit this vehicle to 
operate autonomously, without altering the chassis (in particular, the wheel positions 
or bearings) or the drive train of the vehicle. Teams will be given two runs, alongside 
another vehicle. Runs will be 2 minutes long. During the heat, no team member will 
be permitted beyond the start line. Teams will score the number of complete seconds 
until they knock over the skittle, or two minutes per skittle if they do not knock over 
the skittle. The object is to get the lowest score in a round, and the lowest score from 
the two rounds will be counted. The top four teams will compete in a semi-final and 
the final two in the final. 
In addition to two black skittles there will be a white skittle. Knocking over the white 
skittle will result in disqualification from the round. 
 Teams will see the position of the skittles one minute prior to the start of a 
round. 
 The vehicle must operate autonomously. No external control may be given to 
the vehicle after it has been started. 
 For the purposes of adjudicating a tie, the vehicle displacement from the start 
line at the end of the round will be measured, with longer distances scoring 
higher. 
Marks for the project will be calculated on a group basis. The design and construction 
of the device will be marked out of 300. The team scoring the shortest time (or 
greatest displacement, should no team finish), will be given at additional 30 bonus 
marks. The group coming second will get 15 additional marks. 
The design is unconstrained, except that your design may not run a general purpose 
operating system, such as Linux. Passive components can be requested from the 
workshop. Other components may be requested but a case may need to be made. 
A Technical Documentation File must be produced for the design. This file must 
include: 
 The specification of the design 
 Description of the hardware including circuit diagram and test points/instructions 
 Description of the software including a functional description 
 Usage instructions 
The TDF is not a description of the construction of the project, but a description of the 
end product. A key assessment criteria of the TDF will be how easy it would be, using 
the TDF, to make a modification or extension to the design. It is expected that the 
TDF will be in the order of 25 to 30 pages, including diagrams. 
In addition to the Technical Document File, a Policies and Procedures Document 
(PPD) must be produced documenting your group working practices, and in particular 
code versioning and review, and also measures taken during the design and 
construction phase to increase resilience to delays due to illness or other unforeseen 
circumstances. The PPD is expected to be in the order of one or two pages. 
A descriptive report on the project is not required. However, the log books of each 
project member must be returned with the Technical Documentation File and it is 
expected that these log books will describe the design and debugging process. 
By default, the group mark will be divided equally between all group members. 
However, group members may ask for a different proportional assignment of marks 
between group members at the time the project is submitted. It is up to group 
members themselves to make decisions regarding which group member should 
undertake which part of the design. The project is to be demonstrated during the 
exam diet. The Technical Documentation File must be submitted on or before the 
Monday of the week following the demo. The mark allocated to each student will be 
considered to be a percentage, 70% of which will go towards the final course mark. 
The remaining 30% of the final mark will come from the log book and assignments. 
Room RC6.23 is allocated to the class on Friday for constructing and testing the 
hardware. Safety regulations require that more than one person be present in the 
room when any work is carried out - attending as a group satisfies this requirement
